STLShape
======

This test case is demonstrating the use of STLShape function to mesh a 3D geometry with an obstacle. The domain is a rectangular 3D tank with a rectangular obstacle in the middle (see Figure at the end). The boundaries are read from the multi-block STL file and they have the name of each block. More information on how to use the STLShape function can be found in proteus Documentation
